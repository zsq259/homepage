I am now a third-year undergraduate student at [ACM Honors Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), [Zhiyuan College](https://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/html/zhiyuan/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). Currently, I am a research intern at Brain-Computer and Machine Intelligence (BCMI Lab), advised by Prof. [Hai Zhao](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/home/zhaohai/). My research interest primarily lies in the development of AI systems that can think and act more like humans. While my main focus is on large language models, I am also exploring a broader range of topics within artificial intelligence.
